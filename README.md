Hello Delta, and welcome to your final peer project!

This project requires you to be able to follow online tutorials, fork repositories, and to be able to use someone else's code as a starting point. Build the following application, and use this tutorial as a starting point: https://github.com/NukaPunk/API-JSONWebToken-Auth-Node-Mongo

You should fork the repository as a starting point into a personal repository. Give it whatever name you want. Make sure you know what's happening underneath if you do so. There are parts of the code you will need in order to keep JWT working!

Use jQuery and Bootstrap to create an application that allows users to register, log in/out, create information using a form, and view their own information. This information should be stored in their user in the MongoDB.

Hint: You'll need to add a new property to the user schema that is an array of objects.

This should be a Single Page Application. You may use jQuery along with HTML objects, HTML templates, Handlebars, or any other method to do this. Pick one and stick to it. Just no page refreshing!

The information that should be stored is a list of "Networking Events". Each networking event should have a title, description, location, date and time.

There should also be a "remember me" option when logging in, that stores the JWT in LocalStorage. When the user signs out, make sure you delete this.

(Remember, in a production environment this application should be on HTTPS to avoid giving away your tokens and password. Never transmit this type of data over HTTP!)

# API-JSONWebToken-Auth-Node-Mongo
A simple Node.js API. Users are created and stored in a local database using Mongo, and they are authenticated using JSON Web Tokens.

Inside the `package.json` file we have the following two dependencies for processing json web tokens:

``` javascript
  "express-jwt": "^3.0.1",
  "jsonwebtoken": "^5.0.5"
```

For creating and storing users, we're using the following:

``` javascript
  "bcrypt": "^0.8.5",
  "mongoose": "^4.1.4"
```

Inside of the `app.js` (server side) the following two lines protect our api routes from everything that doesn't send an authorization header with a correct token:

``` javascript
  var expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
  app.use('/api/*', expressJwt({secret: 'supersecret'}));
```

You could change these routes to be whatever you need.

Also inside of `app.js`, the following error handler deals with unauthorized errors when express-jwt doesn't find a token. Without this middleware, you'll just get 500 errors back.

``` javascript
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
    if (err.name === 'UnauthorizedError') {
        res.send(401, 'invalid token...');
    }
});
```

We then set up mongoose with the following:

``` javascript

// Bring Mongoose into the app
var mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

// Build the connection string
var dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/jsonwebtoken';

// Create the database connection
mongoose.connect(dbURI);

// CONNECTION EVENTS
// When successfully connected
mongoose.connection.on('connected', function () {
    console.log('Mongoose default connection open to ' + dbURI);
});

// If the connection throws an error
mongoose.connection.on('error',function (err) {
    console.log('Mongoose default connection error: ' + err);
});

// When the connection is disconnected
mongoose.connection.on('disconnected', function () {
    console.log('Mongoose default connection disconnected');
});

```

Our users are then created in the `models/users.js` file. This is a pretty simple Mongoose schema...

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose')
    , bcrypt = require('bcrypt')
    , SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10;
    
var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    firstName: {type: String, required: true},
    lastName: {type: String, required: true},
    username: {type: String, required: true, index: {unique: true}},
    password: {type: String, required: true}
});
```

...with a pre save hook set up for password encryption using Bcrypt: 

``` javascript
UserSchema.pre('save', function (next) {
    var user = this;
    console.log('saving user!');
    // only hash the password if it has been modified (or is new)
    if (!user.isModified('password')) return next();

    // generate a salt
    bcrypt.genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR, function (err, salt) {
        if (err) return next(err);

        // hash the password along with our new salt
        bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, function (err, hash) {
            if (err) return next(err);

            // override the clear-text password with the hashed one
            user.password = hash;
            next();
        });
    });
});
```

Also using Bcrypt, we can compare passwords using a mongoose `method`, which will understand the context of the current user:

``` javascript
UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = function (candidatePassword, callback) {
    bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, this.password, function (err, isMatch) {
        if (err) return callback(err);
        return callback(null, isMatch);
    });
};
```

Finally, we actually create the user tokens using jsonwebtoken:

``` javascript
jsonwebtoken = require('jsonwebtoken')
```

*Note that the `UserSchema.statics.Create`function is omitted, as it doesn't pertain to this walkthrough. Feel free to browse the source to see the static functions for creating users.*

Finally, inside of the `User.statics.getAuthenticated` function we have the magic, which returns the tokenized user as well as a user object for our Ajax to play with.

``` javascript
UserSchema.statics.getAuthenticated = function (user, callback) {
    console.log('getAuthenticated', user);
    this.findOne({username: user.username}, function (err, doc) {
        if (err) {
            console.log(err);
            return callback(err);
        }

        // make sure the user exists
        else if (!doc) {
            console.log('No user found,');
            return callback(new Error('Invalid username or password.', 401), null);
        }
        else {
            // test for a matching password
            doc.comparePassword(user.password, function (err, isMatch) {
                if (err) {
                    console.log(err);
                    return callback(err);
                }

                // check if the password was a match
                if (isMatch) {

                    // return the jwt
                    var token = jsonwebtoken.sign(doc, 'supersecret', {
                        expiresInMinutes: 1440 // expires in 24 hours
                    });
                    return callback(null, token, doc);
                }
                else {
                    return callback(new Error('Invalid username or password.'), null);

                }
            });
        }
    });
};
```

Inside of our client side javascript `public/javascripts/app.js` we have mostly just Ajax calls. However, the major parts are the following.


The login ajax function finishes by saving the returned token to the localStorage: 

``` JavaScript
localStorage.setItem('userToken', data.token);
```

And then finally, we set up Ajax to always include the token, as taken from localStorage:

``` javascript
function setupAjax() {
    $.ajaxSetup({
        'beforeSend': function (xhr) {
            if (localStorage.getItem('userToken')) {
                xhr.setRequestHeader('Authorization',
                    'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('userToken'));
            }
        }
    });
}
```

We also call `setupAjax` on page load, just in case there is a previous token saved.

That's it! Once a user logs in, they can click the `test` button to prove that their restricted API is indeed pulling information in through an Ajax call.
